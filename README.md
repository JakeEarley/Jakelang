# jakelang
An interpreted language written in .NET.

Originally created in response to both a challenge and a dare, Jakelang poses to be a demonstration of how a simple interpreter
can be written using the Visual Basic language.

Documentation is available and is mostly up to date for Build 14. Also contained is a selection of demonstration programs which can be run on the interpreter.

To use the Jakelang interpreter, run the .exe and type the name of the .JAKELANG file. The .JAKELANG file should be stored in the same folder as the interpreter. The interpreter will then run the .JAKELANG file on that command window.
